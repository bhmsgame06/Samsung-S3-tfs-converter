# Samsung-S3-tfs-converter
The program is written in Java and is designed to convert Samsung S3 (not only S3) phone firmware files TFS/CSC (without CFG/CCF file configuration) to a zip files.

The program will not convert TFS/CSC firmware files with CFG/CCF configuration files to zip archive, 'cause this is a different file structure.
